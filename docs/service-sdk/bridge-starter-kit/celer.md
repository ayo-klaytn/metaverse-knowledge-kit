# ðŸŒ‰ Celer
Celer Bridge (cBridge) is a cross-chain bridge that helps in moving assets from one chain to the other with lower costs. Please refer to the [Official Documentation](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network) for detailed information on Celer.

This module provides scripts to help you interact/integrate cBridge into your applications robustly without explicitly digging into cBridge technical documentation. Basic features included in the package are: 

**Pool Based Transfer (Liquidity)**
1. **PoolTransfer** : Liquidity transfer from one chain to another by locking funds in source chain and releasing funds in destination chain.
2. **PoolTransfer Refund** : Request refund for any failed pool transfer transactions.

**Canonical Mapping Transfer (Asset)**
1. **MintCanonical Token** : Mint or Deposit tokens on the source chain 
2. **MintCanonical Token Refund** : Request refund for any failed mint transactions
3. **BurnCanonical Token** : Burn or withdraw tokens on pegged chain
4. **BurnCanonical Token Refund** : Request refund for any failed burn transactions
 
Follow the below steps to try out the above features using the sdk. 

## Installation
```sh
npm install @kaiachain/kss-bridges-celer --save
```

## Quick Start
There are two modules in the celer bridge starter kit.
  1. BridgeSDK provides the implementation and examples of bridge use-cases.
  2. CoreBridgeSDK exposes methods of `celer` core functions to write custom snippets.

```typescript
import BridgeSDK from '@kaiachain/kss-bridges-celer';
import CoreBridgeSDK from '@kaiachain/kss-bridges-celer/core';

or

const BridgeSDK = require('@kaiachain/kss-bridges-celer');
const CoreBridgeSDK = require('@kaiachain/kss-bridges-celer/core');
```

> **_NOTE:_** Please make sure the wallet provided has enough balance in source/destination to perform the transactions.

### 1. PoolBased Transfer
You will be able to transfer your funds using cBridge's `pool based transfer` method. It's a liquidity based transfer in which your funds are locked at source_chain (sending chain) and released on destination_chain (receiving chain) from a pool of liquidity available on the destination chain.

```typescript
BridgeSDK.poolTransfer(transferObj)
```

#### Parameters
`transferObj` - `Object`
  * `CBRIDGE_GATEWAY_URL` - `string` From [here](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/developer/cbridge-sdk#cbridge-testnet-endpoint) you can get Testnet & Mainnet cBridge's Gateway URLs.
  * `WALLET_ADDRESS` - `string` address of your account.
  * `PRIVATE_KEY` - `string` private key of your account.
  * `SRC_CHAIN_ID` - `number` chain ID of source-chain. From [here](https://chainlist.org) you can get the chain ID of your source-chain.

  * `SRC_CHAIN_RPC` - `string` RPC endpoint of your source-chain (the chain from where you want to send your tokens to).
  * `TOKEN_SYMBOL` - `string` SYMBOL of your token, which you want to move from source chain to destination.
You can get SYMBOLS of supported tokens with the pair of chains you've mentioned above at [cBridge](https://test-cbridge-v2.celer.network/5/71401/USDC) web interface
  * `AMOUNT` - `string` `amount` of token, you want to move from source to destination chain Ex: 1 USDC
  * `SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE` - `number` slippage amount you can tolerate while transferring your tokens from source to destination chain. Please go through [celer slippage_tolerance](https://cbridge-docs.celer.network/developer/api-reference/gateway-estimateamt) for more info.

  - you can get maxBurn & minBurn amount from [this Godwoken cBridge contract](https://gw-explorer.nervosdao.community/address/0x70D4814e111Ad66B90B90D54a44797BC696BcdAF/read-contract#address-tabs).
